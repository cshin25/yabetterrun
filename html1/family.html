<h1>What makes Officer Earl an amazing family man</h1>
<p>The man is ready to take charge and responsibility for his son and wife. It is clear that he shows the utmost love and compassion for his family. Much of the will in his work is to cater to his loved ones and making sure they are safe. During one scene where the family is running away from a foodalanche, (food avalanche) he musters the strength to single handedly carry a ginormous food boat and toss it into the ocean to escape with his family. Officer Earl really did bend the power of reality to save those important to him. His character development also allowed him to befriend Flint and defend him in the time that it was needed.<p>

<h2>Can you cosplay as Officer Earl?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can. This proud authority figure can be worn in many instances. Is the main reason why I had this heading is for a picture of Terry Crews dressed as his character? Yes. Yes I did.</p>
