      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/about.css">Although one of the best movies were already played in front of us, many people often forget the gem released in 2009. And with that lost information, this police officer is forgotten among the masses as well.
  That's right, Earl Devereux, more widely known as Officer Earl. A hard core cop, the man can do no wrong and has the most determination to help the people, along with his family. </p>

<h2>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</h2>
<p>Released in 2009 and the sequel in 2013, Officer Earl is first featured with his overly macho figure, looming over Flint who is working on his invention. (voiced by Mr. T in the first movie and Terry Crews in the sequel) Now as a kid, you kinda saw Officer Earl as a no-nonsense cop who stamps out all types of fun. However, his character development is clearly illustrated and eventually becomes one of Flint's closest friends.</p>
<h2 style="color:#192f91;">A Family Man</h2>
<p> With Strong evidence, Officer Earl clearly shows his love and support for his family. His wife and son is marked as his pride and joy. Even as the tides begin to turn, he is always there for them. Here, you can find a link through this amazing picture of Earl adapting. This was after the food disaster from the first movie. </p>
